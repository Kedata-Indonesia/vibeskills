# Skill: Kedata Ask — Where Is This Codebase?

## Purpose
Orient anyone — a new developer, a returning user, or an agent in a fresh session — who does not know where the codebase currently stands in the Kedata delivery pipeline. This skill **inspects the approved artifacts on disk** (no guessing), maps what exists to the pipeline stage, and answers three questions: *where is this codebase right now, what is the next step, and which skill should be used?* It is the map of the pipeline: it does not create anything, it tells you where you are and what to run next.

**The pipeline this skill navigates (one skill per artifact / activity):**

| # | Stage | Produces / Does | Skill to run |
|---|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| 0 | Idea *(optional)* | `IDEA_BRIEF.md` (business grill of a raw idea) — **not a gate** | `kedata-brainstorm` |
| 1 | Requirements | `PRD.md` (interview) | `kedata-prd` |
| 2 | Design | `DESIGN_BRIEF.md` (reads PRD.md, interview) | `kedata-design-brief` |
| — | Mockups | designer/LLM produces mockups from the brief | *external* |
| 3 | Planning | `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (reads PRD + brief, interview) | `kedata-implementation-plan` |
| 4 | Contracts | `API_CONTRACTS.md` + `DATA_CATALOG.md` + `ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md` (reads PRD + plan) | `kedata-contracts` |
| 5 | Engineering session | Loads the baseline rules (reads all artifacts once per session) | `kedata-system` |
| 6 | Implementation | Write code per the chosen stack (plan §4) | `kedata-backend-*` / `kedata-frontend-*` |
| 7 | Review | Review the code against the artifacts before merge | `kedata-review` |
| 8 | Repo communication | Open PR/MR, link issues, GitHub/GitLab | `kedata-repo` |

Artifacts are checked at `docs/<FILE>.md` first, then root `<FILE>.md`.

## When to Use
* User command: `/kedata-ask`
* Autonomous trigger: When the user says "what should I do next?", "where is this project at?", "what's the status of this repo?", "I'm new here — what has been done?", or asks which skill to use; at the start of any session where the repo state is unknown.

## Prerequisites & Context Gathering
Before reporting, the agent MUST inspect the repo (do NOT ask the user — the artifacts answer):

1. **Check which pipeline artifacts exist** (`docs/` first, then root):
   * `IDEA_BRIEF.md` *(optional pre-PRD artifact — its absence does NOT block the pipeline)*
   * `PRD.md`
   * `DESIGN_BRIEF.md`
   * `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
   * `API_CONTRACTS.md`, `DATA_CATALOG.md`, `ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md`
2. **Check for code:** backend/frontend directories, `go.mod` / `package.json` / `pyproject.toml` / `Cargo.toml`, `src/` or `app/` folders.
3. **If `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` exists, read §4** to learn the chosen stack (e.g. "Go + Nuxt") — this determines which backend/frontend skill to recommend.
4. **If code exists, check repo state:** uncommitted changes (`git status`), open PR/MR (`gh pr list` / `glab mr list`), unpushed commits (`git log origin/<branch>..HEAD`).
5. Ask the user for clarification ONLY IF:
   * The repo has none of the artifacts AND no code — confirm whether this is a brand-new project (→ start at stage 1) or a repo we are joining mid-stream (→ check for a remote/other branch).
   * The user has a specific goal in mind (e.g. "I want to add a feature") that contradicts the artifact-derived next step — report both, then follow their goal.

## Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Inspect
* Run the artifact checks above and record found/missing for each.
* Read the plan §4 stack if the plan exists.

### Step 2: Map to Stage
Find the **furthest completed stage** by the presence of its artifact (each stage's artifact must exist to count as done):
* No `PRD.md` and no code → stage 1 not started. If the user also has only a **raw idea**, offer stage 0 (`kedata-brainstorm`, optional) as a business-validity check before the PRD — but make clear the PRD can be written directly if the idea is already validated. Never gate the PRD on an `IDEA_BRIEF.md`.
* `IDEA_BRIEF.md` present, no `PRD.md` → idea validated; next is stage 1 (`kedata-prd`), using the brief as context.
* `PRD.md` only → stages 1 done; next is 2.
* `PRD.md` + `DESIGN_BRIEF.md` → next is mockups / stage 3.
* `PRD.md` + `DESIGN_BRIEF.md` + `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` → next is stage 4 (contracts).
* All four artifacts (PRD, brief, plan, contracts) → planning complete; next is engineering (stages 5–6).
* Code present → engineering in progress; next is review (stage 7) then repo (stage 8).
* Open PR/MR → stage 8 in progress; remaining work is review/merge.

### Step 3: Report Status
Present a compact status report (see Example Output Structure below):
* **Pipeline position** — which stage the codebase is at, with evidence (artifacts found/missing).
* **Next step** — exactly what must happen next.
* **Skill to use** — the skill to run for the next step, and its command.
* **Blockers / notes** — e.g. contracts missing before coding can start; stack not decided in the plan; mockups not produced.

### Step 4: Hand-Off
* If the next skill is not installed, tell the user how to install it: `npx skills@latest add Kedata-Indonesia/vibeskills -s <skill>`.
* End with a clear, single next action — not a list of options.

## Constraints & Guardrails
* **DO NOT** guess the pipeline position — base it on the artifacts actually on disk.
* **DO NOT** create, modify, or fill any artifact — this skill only inspects and reports.
* **DO NOT** re-interview the user for requirements — that is what the artifact-producing skills do.
* **DO NOT** recommend a stack-specific skill unless the plan §4 says that stack.
* **DO NOT** treat `IDEA_BRIEF.md` / `kedata-brainstorm` as a required stage — it is optional; never block the PRD on it or report it as a missing blocker.
* **DO NOT** dump the whole pipeline table unless the user asks — keep the report to where they are, what's next, and what to run.
* Keep the report short and decisive: position, next step, skill, blockers.

## Example Output Structure

## 📍 Where this codebase is

**Stage 4 of 8 — Planning done, contracts not yet drafted.**

| Artifact | Status |
|----------|--------|
| `docs/PRD.md` | ✅ found |
| `docs/DESIGN_BRIEF.md` | ✅ found |
| `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` | ✅ found (§4: Go + Nuxt 3, MongoDB Atlas) |
| `docs/API_CONTRACTS.md` | ❌ missing |
| `docs/DATA_CATALOG.md` | ❌ missing |
| `docs/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md` | ❌ missing |
| Code | ❌ none yet |

## ➡️ Next step
Draft the engineering contracts — the backend and frontend cannot start without them.

**Run:** `/kedata-contracts` (reads PRD.md + IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, interviews you, produces API_CONTRACTS.md, DATA_CATALOG.md, ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md).

**Not installed?** `npx skills@latest add Kedata-Indonesia/vibeskills -s kedata-contracts`

## ⚠️ Blockers
- None — this is the correct next step.

### Another example — engineering in progress
**Stage 6 of 8 — Implementation in progress.**

- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` ✅ · contracts ✅ · Go code present in `backend/`, no frontend yet
- Stack from plan §4: Go + Gin backend, Nuxt frontend
- Next: implement the frontend → **run `/kedata-frontend-nuxt`**; after both sides are done, run `/kedata-review` before opening the PR, then `/kedata-repo` to open the MR/PR.
